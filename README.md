# Guided-Project--Investigating-Fandango-Movie-Ratings-

In this guided project by Dataquest, I have analyzed data on ratings of popular movies on Fandango's website. In an analysis by Walter Hickley, it had been found that Fandango 
had been posting inflated movie ratings. This was because Fandango also sells movie tickets, and so posting inflated movie ratings was an attempt by the company to sell more movie tickets.
However, after the analysis by Hickley, Fandango claimed to have fixed their movie ratings. In this project, I have analyzed the movie ratings from before and after Fandango claimed to 
have fixed their rating system. 
At the end of the analysis, I found that Fandango's ratings in 2016 were lower than those in 2015.
